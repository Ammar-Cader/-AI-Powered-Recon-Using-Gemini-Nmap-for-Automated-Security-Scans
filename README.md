# 🤖🔍 AI-Powered Recon: Using Gemini + Nmap for Automated Security Scans

After reading the article:
https://hackers-arise.com/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity-using-ai-for-port-scanning/ by @Hackers-arise which guides on how to set up a CLI LLM to conduct nmap scans using “LLM NMAP”:https://github.com/peter-hackertarget/llm-tools-nmap

I decided to give it a try, as someone who uses “nmap” for most networking and security activities I spend most of the time in the man pages for syntaxes or articles on the different scripts for Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) for my different needs this process makes the job more simple, efficient and productive.

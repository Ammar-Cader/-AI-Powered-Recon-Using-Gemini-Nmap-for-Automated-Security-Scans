The following information was gathered for 192.168.10.148:\
\
**Open Ports and Services:**\
\
*   **22/tcp:** SSH (OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.13, protocol 2.0)\
*   **80/tcp:** HTTP (nginx 1.18.0 Ubuntu) - Runs Jellyfin, and `/` is a disallowed entry in `robots.txt`.\
*   **139/tcp:** NetBIOS Session Service (Samba smbd 4.6.2)\
*   **445/tcp:** Microsoft-DS (Samba smbd 4.6.2)\
*   **8096/tcp:** Unknown service - likely Jellyfin as it's a common port for it.\
\
**Operating System:**\
\
*   Linux (Ubuntu, based on OpenSSH and Nginx versions).\
*   Nmap's OS detection suggests `cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`.\
\
**Samba Information:**\
\
*   Samba `smbd 4.6.2` is running.\
*   SMB2 security mode: Message signing is enabled but not required.\
\
**Items of Interest to a Security Analyst:**\
\
1.  **Outdated Samba Version:** Samba `4.6.2` is quite old. This version likely has known vulnerabilities. Upgrading Samba to a newer, patched version is highly recommended.\
2.  **Jellyfin Exposed on Port 80:** Jellyfin is a media server. Exposing it directly on port 80 without HTTPS means all traffic, including login credentials, is sent in plaintext. This is a significant security risk. It should be configured to use HTTPS.\
3.  **SSH Open:** While necessary for remote administration, OpenSSH should be secured. Recommendations include:\
    *   Disabling root login.\
    *   Using strong, complex passwords or, preferably, SSH keys for authentication.\
    *   Considering a firewall to limit SSH access to trusted IPs.\
    *   Keeping OpenSSH updated. The current version `8.9p1` is relatively recent, but regular patching is still important.\
4.  **SMB Message Signing Not Required:** Although enabled, the fact that SMB message signing is not *required* could potentially allow for man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could tamper with SMB traffic. It's generally a good practice to require SMB signing.\
5.  **Unknown Service on Port 8096:** While likely Jellyfin, any unknown open port warrants further investigation to understand its purpose and assess potential risks.\
6.  **`robots.txt` Disallowed Entry:** The `/` entry in `http-robots.txt` for the Nginx server indicates that the server administrator doesn't want search engines to index the root directory. While not a security vulnerability in itself, it shows an attempt at controlling access/visibility and might hint at sensitive content.\
\
**Recommendations:**\
\
*   **Upgrade Samba:** Update Samba to the latest stable version to mitigate known vulnerabilities.\
*   **Enable HTTPS for Jellyfin:** Configure Nginx and Jellyfin to use HTTPS to encrypt all web traffic. Obtain and install a valid SSL/TLS certificate.\
*   **Secure SSH:** Implement best practices for SSH security (disable root login, use SSH keys, restrict access).\
*   **Require SMB Signing:** Configure Samba to *require* SMB message signing.\
*   **Investigate Port 8096:** Confirm the service running on port 8096 and secure it appropriately. If it is Jellyfin, ensure it's also behind HTTPS or not directly exposed if not intended.\
*   **Regular Patching:** Ensure all software on the system (OS, Nginx, OpenSSH, Samba, Jellyfin) is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.\
*   **Firewall:** Implement a host-based firewall (e.g., UFW on Ubuntu) to restrict access to only necessary ports and trusted IP addresses.}
